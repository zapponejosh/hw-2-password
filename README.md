# Password Generator

Creates a password and allowing user to select which kinds of character they would like and the length of the passsword. After it is generated user can copy password to their clipboard.

_Do not use this as a secure way to generate a password._

#### Character sets include:
* Lowercase letters (required)
* Uppercase letters
* Symbols
* Numbers

#### Password length
Password must be 8 or _more_ characters and no greater than 128.

#### Uses buttons and a number input
After creating a generator using browser prompts, alerts, and confirms I decided to make a better user experience and added buttons with checkboxes and a input that acceppted numbers.
